# DSA-SHEET-CHALLENGE

This repository contains my personal journey of practicing Data Structures and Algorithms. I created this repo to track my progress, stay consistent, and improve my problem-solving skills.

💡 What this repo includes

> My solutions to daily DSA problems

> Notes and approaches I used to solve each question

> Topic-wise problem breakdown (Arrays, Strings, DP, Trees, Graphs, etc.)

> Checklists to track what I’ve completed

> Optimized solutions as I improve over time

🎯 Purpose

To build a strong foundation in DSA for interviews, placement preparation, and regular practice — all in one place.
